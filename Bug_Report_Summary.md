## 💭 Reflection  

Answer briefly (1–2 paragraphs):

- What was your testing approach?
I have interacted with the app in the browser to observe how it responded to different inputs (dynamic testing). This helped me identify bugs like the ability to add empty tasks and the lack of editing or deleting features.  
- What did you find easy or difficult during the task?  
I found it easy to spot visible issues like missing validations. However, it was a bit challenging to determine whether certain features (like editing or deleting) were missing by design or just not implemented yet. The hardest part was thinking about the user's expectations and checking features that weren’t obviously missing.
- How confident are you now in identifying and reporting bugs?
Overall, I feel more confident in identifying and reporting bugs clearly. Using GitHub Issues with a structured format made it easier to communicate the problems effectively.
